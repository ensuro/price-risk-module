# Price Risk Module

This is a Price Risk Module for the Ensuro Protocol.

The policies of this module allow to protect against the future price of an asset.

You can acquire policies that will be triggered at a price lower or higher than the current price. After the policy was created, if the price is lower/higher than the trigger price, the policy will be triggered releasing the payout.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
```
